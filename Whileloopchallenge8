#While loop challenge8 (gcsecs.com)

#part of this code it missing.
#It should ask the user to guess a number over and over again, but..
#only give them 5 attempts.
#If they guess correct, it displays 'Yay! Correct guess'
#otherwise it prints 'You are out of attempts'
#HINT: Use an "and" opertor


import random
number = random.randint(1,10)
attempts = 0
guess = ""


#add a While loop here
while attempts < 5 and number != guess:
  guess=int(input("Pick a number between 1-10"))
  attempts = attempts + 1

if guess == number:
   print("yay correct guess!")
else:
    print("You are out of attempts")
